# ZL Code Playground (client-side)

## Introduction

- An in-browser compile & bundle code-editor for JavaScript.
  It is inspired and modified from [a great course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-and-typescript-build-a-portfolio-project/) taught by Stephen Grider. Definitely deserve to check it out!
- If you are familiar with Python, this is more like a JavaScript version Jupyter notebook. Perfect for practising interview questions or running the short demo for unfamiliar packages.
- This repo is the development version and only contains the client-side code for the project. But is still fully usable.
